This folder contains DBC and map data required by the core.

dbc - DBCs are mandatory and can be edited with MyDbcEditor.

maps - Maps are mandatory. There's not much to say about them.

vmaps - Vmaps are optional. Without them there can be no LoS checks, and you'll be able to cast through walls.

mmaps - Mmaps are optional and you need 2GB of RAM to load them. Without them mobs will walk through walls.

You should not touch things in this folder if you don't know what you're doing.
